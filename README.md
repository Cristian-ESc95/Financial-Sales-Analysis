### Key Insights
- Technology and Office Supplies are the most profitable categories. Furniture generates a lot of revenue but contributes very little to profit. I would recomend analyzing costs or pricing strategy.
- Tables (Furniture), Bookcases (Furniture), and Supplies (Office Supplies) generate negative profit. I recommend reviewing their pricing or supplier costs, or considering discontinuing these products.
- Based on the Pareto chart, around 20% of the products sold (Copiers, Phones, and Accessories) generate nearly 80% of the companyâ€™s overall profit. However, when comparing these products with the Profit Margin chart, they are not the most efficient in terms of profitability. I recommend negotiating better costs to increase their margins.
- Products such as Labels and Envelopes have excellent profit margins but lower sales volumes. Consider marketing these more aggressively or bundling them with popular items to increase their total contribution.
- Discounts beyond 20% destroy Profit Margin.
- High-revenue customers don't always generate high profit (Sean Miller, Ken Londsdale, Sanjit Engle, Christopher Conant).Consider launching a loyalty program or targeted promotions to reward the most profitable customers and strengthen long-term relationships.
- Loss-making customers represent 18,07%. It's recommended to optimise discount policies to reduce negative margins.
- The company generates $2.30M in revenue with a profit margin of 12.49%, showing solid but uneven regional performance. West and East drive most of the company's profit led by California and New York. Consider to analyze the cost structure, particularly logistic and distribution expenses in states with low or negative profit margins.
